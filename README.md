Welcome to our Unity game project! This README will provide an overview of the key components and features of the project, along with visual demonstrations.

## Scene Setup

Our game scene is meticulously designed and includes essential GameObjects. We have a GameManager prefab that controls the game flow and at least 10 GameObjects with GamePoint components, which serve as the main collectibles or objectives within the game.

To make our game more visually appealing and engaging, we've integrated additional assets. These assets come from various sources, including the Unity Asset Store and custom models/images. We have incorporated a minimum of three additional assets to enrich the gameplay environment.

We've implemented diverse behaviors to create an interactive and dynamic game world. At least two different behaviors have been added or modified through scripts to enhance gameplay and interactivity.

## Object Behaviors

Every GamePoint object in our game has unique behaviors attached to them, making collecting points a challenging and rewarding experience for players. These behaviors add depth to the gameplay.

## Environment Behaviors

Not only are the point objects interactive, but we've also added behaviors to at least three objects in the game environment. These interactive elements make the game world come alive and offer new challenges to players.
